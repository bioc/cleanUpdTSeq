Title: cleanUpdTSeq cleans up artifacts from polyadenylation sites from 
  oligo(dT)-mediated 3' end RNA sequending data
Description: This package implements a Naive Bayes classifier for accurately
  differentiating true polyadenylation sites (pA sites) from oligo(dT)-mediated
  3' end sequencing such as PAS-Seq, PolyA-Seq and RNA-Seq by filtering out false 
  polyadenylation sites, mainly due to oligo(dT)-mediated internal priming 
  during reverse transcription. The classifer is highly accurate and outperforms
  other heuristic methods.
