Description: This package implements a Naive Bayes classifier for accurate
        identification of polyadenylation sites (pA sites) from oligodT based
            3 prime end sequencing such as PAS-Seq, PolyA-Seq and RNA-Seq. The classifer
            is highly accurate and outperforms heuristic methods.
